To develop:

1. `npm run build-watch` for live transpilation of the component.

2. In another terminal, run one of the examples:

        cd examples/logic
        npm install
        npm run serve
        open http://localhost:9966/

3. Now you can edit the files in `src` (or `examples/logic`) and
   changes will be reflected immediately in your browser.
